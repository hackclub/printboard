    <h2 class="headline">What is the IKEA pegboard?</h2>
    <p>
        The IKEA SKÅDIS is a 30 by 22 inch wooden board with many holes for you to connect your designs to the wall. It is often used by 3D modelers and hackers to easily connect prints to the wall without needing screws or adhesives.

    <h2 class="headline">What are the requirements?</h2>
    <p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Your submission must be unique. If a similar 3D model already exists (check on sites like Thingiverse) you will be asked to clarify what makes yours better</li>
            <li>Your submission must have a purpose and solve a problem.</li>
            <li>You must be 18 or under.</li>

  <div class="card container">
    <h2 class="headline">What are some examples of projects?</h2>
    <p>
      Anything you want to store! Some examples are something to store a collection— like retro games or cards, or something to hold the random electronic parts we all have lying around, or even something to mount a camera— it can be anything!
